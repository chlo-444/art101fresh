        <p>Block 1. The Womens Lacrosse Team at UC Santa Cruz just kicked off their off season with a scrimmage in
            San Francisco! Playing against an adult league set up by their Coach Lex. This team had some UCSC alumni
            with
            a wide range of ages on the field. It was a loss for our slugs, but a lot was learned for this newly formed
            team.

        <p>Block 2. Although lacrosse is
            a spring sport, practice games are very important. League games will begin in January of 2026. Janurary 24th
            to be exact, a game against Stanford here on our lower east field. Come support your favorite group of Slugs
            to defeat the Trees! </p>
